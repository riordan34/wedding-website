Although day 1 was not off to the hottest of starts, a semester full of grading sessions and classes dealing with shockingly annoying undergrads laid the foundation for friendship. After, what some would deem, a "resolutely-cute-and-not-at-all-pathetic" persistence, Sarah and Kenny went out on their first date a mere 163 days after meeting (not that anyone was counting). The next two years were full of long runs, long distance, and long road trips, but all the tough times they endured and great times they enjoyed helped their story, and their appreciation for one another, grow immensely.</p>

    <h1 class="cursive-large text-silver">October 27, 2017</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.25em" class="text-silver">Mid-October, I added "~fun activity~" to our calendar on October 27, 2017 after Kenny mentioned wanting to have a date night.  Little did I know all the planning that had already gone into that day, including Kenny (frantically, I'm sure) texting a mutual friend to tell her she *had* to cancel plans she and I made that evening, no matter what the excuse.  Despite the sadness over canceled plans, I was excited when I opened my birthday present a week later: tickets to see Beauty & the Beast downtown on October 27, 2017.<br><br>The next week flew by with only a few suspicious slip-ups: in particular, my dad telling me "see you Friday [the 27th]" when leaving his house the weekend before.  As Friday approached, my friend Vanya texted that she had a big presentation the next Monday and wanted to practice with me that Friday evening.  With some confusion, I agreed -- as long as I had time to go home and change before going downtown ("Why can't we practice Saturday or Sunday? Why Friday evening?").  With more confusion and eye rolls, Vanya eventually convinced me to get ready for the show on campus before her practice presentation, with the bribe that another friend, Nicole, would curl my hair -- a task I have yet to master.<br><br>I arrived Friday morning at CMU with a packed bag and a packed day.  Between class, meetings, and volunteering, I didn't have much time to notice the suspicious activities of Vanya, Nicole, and Kenny.  When I did realize that Vanya was MIA and not responding to texts, Nicole played right along.  I became increasingly more aware of their odd behavior when Nicole insisted on WHAT dress I wear and WHEN I should change, when others in the office [unknowingly] made comments about how they thought Vanya was up to something, and when Kenny called me to say he was stuck in traffic when it *clearly* didn't sound like he was in the car.<br><br>When Nicole and I arrived (only a littttttle late) at the supposed scene of the practice presentation, there was a sign on the door that led me to Wean 7500: the CMU classroom where Kenny and I first met about three years prior. I immediately recognized the room number and felt butterflies of excitement and nervousness in my stomach.  As I opened the door to Wean 7500, I couldn't believe what I saw: an old lecture hall transformed with lights and flowers.  The table at the front had a book Kenny had written about our relationship's journey, titled "And Our Story Grew From There".  As I finished reading, Kenny walked down, got down on one knee, and asked me to marry him; in between happy tears,<br><p style="font-size:3em;text-align:center; " class="text-silver"><strong>I SAID YES!</strong></p><br>
    <img class="background-wine" src="./WebsitePictures/RoomCollage.png" style="width: 100%">
    <br><p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.25em" class="text-silver">Luckily, Vanya & Nicole were there to capture the happy moment.<br>The surprises continued! As it turned out, we weren't going to Beauty & the Beast that night.  Instead, Kenny invited close family and friends to celebrate, and they were all waiting for us at a nearby restaurant (we were only a littttttle more late).  The next few days were filled with smiles and champagne, and our story grew from there...</p></p>
